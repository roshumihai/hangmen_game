# Hangman Game

This is a simple hangman game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman_game.py` script.
2. You need to guess the word letter by letter. You have 10 lives to guess the word correctly.
3. You will be shown a series of dashes representing the letters in the word. Guess a letter by typing it and pressing Enter.
4. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. Otherwise, you lose a life.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
6. Have fun!
